### What is Kubernetes?
Ans.Kubernetes  is an open-source container orchestration platform,
    that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    It was originally developed by "Google" and is now maintained by the "Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF)".

### Explain of Arcitecture in K8s?
Ans.Kubernetes (K8s) follows a Master Node-Worker Node architecture :- 
    Master Node ntg but "Control Plane" manages the Clusters and Orchestrates operations.
    ### Master Nodes components :-
    1. API Server (kube-apiserver) ---> "Acts as the entry point for all Kubernetes operations (REST API)".
    2. etcd (Database) ---> "A key-values store that holds all cluster data (state, configuration, etc)".
    3. Scheduler (kube-scheduler) ---> "Assigns pods to worker nodes based on available resources and policies".
    4. Controller-Manager ---> "The Controller Manager continuously monitors and maintains the desired state".

    Worker Node that run containerized applications.
    ### Worker Nodes components :-
    1. Kubelet ---> "The Kubelet on that Worker Node communicates with the API Server to ensure the Pod is running".
    2. Kube Proxy ---> "Kube Proxy ensures networking and allows communication between Pods and Services".
    3. Container Runtime ---> "The Container Runtime starts the container(s) inside the Pod".
    4. Pods (containers inside) ---> "A group of one or more containers running instances of an application".

### What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
Ans.Pod is the smallest and simplest deployable unit in Kubernetes, 
    It represents one or more containers that share the same network and storage.

### What is a Kubernetes Service?
Ans.A Kubernetes Service is a logical abstraction that ensures stable networking for a group of Pods.
    Since Pods are ephemeral and their IP addresses change dynamically,
    a Service provides a fixed IP address and DNS name to ensure continuous connectivity.
    Types of Services:-
    1.ClusterIP is best for internal communication.
    2.NodePort allows external access via a fixed port.
    3.LoadBalancer is ideal for cloud-based public services.
    4.ExternalName links to external resources.
