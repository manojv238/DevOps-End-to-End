### What is Ansible ?
Ans.Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, infrastructure provisioning, 
    application deployment and orchestration by using YAML-based playbooks.
    It works by connecting to remote machines via SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows),
    executing tasks without requiring agents.


### What are the key features of Ansible?
Ans.
ðŸ“Œ Agentless â€“ No need to install agents on managed nodes.
ðŸ“Œ Simple YAML Syntax â€“ Uses human-readable YAML for playbooks.
ðŸ“Œ Idempotency â€“ Ensures changes apply only when needed.
ðŸ“Œ Scalability â€“ Manages thousands of servers efficiently.
ðŸ“Œ Pre-built Modules â€“ Extensive library for automation tasks.
ðŸ“Œ Orchestration â€“ Automates multi-tier app deployments.
ðŸ“Œ Secure & Reliable â€“ Uses SSH and Ansible Vault for security.
ðŸ“Œ Push Model Execution â€“ Executes tasks from the control node directly.


### Difference Between Ansible, Shell, and Python?
Ans.
ðŸ“Œ Shell (Bash/PowerShell):
âœ… Good for one-time execution for shell script but lacks of scalability for complex automation.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Shell is wont work with different OS.(linux,ubuntu,windows).

ðŸ“Œ Python:
âœ… More flexible than Shell, supports both Linux and Windows.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Writing a script to manage multiple services dynamically.

ðŸ“Œ Ansible:
âœ… Best for managing multiple VMs with different OS types.
âœ… Uses inventory files to define different hosts and apply the right module automatically.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Write a Playbook, configure, and start Nginx on multiple servers.

ðŸ“ŒðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ Final Recommendation:
âœ… If it's a one-time task, use Shell scripts.
âœ… If you want custom logic & flexibility, use Python.
âœ… If you need scalability, reusability, and automation, Ansible is the best choice.


### What is Ansible Inventory?
Ans.Ansible inventory is a file or source that contains information about managed hosts (nodes),where Ansible will execute tasks.
It defines groups of hosts and their connection details, such as IP addresses, SSH users, and authentication methods.
--------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“Œ Types of Ansible Inventory:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Static Inventory (Default: /etc/ansible/hosts):-
âœ… A simple file with manually defined hosts and groups.
ðŸ”¹ Example (inventory.ini): "ini-Extention"
--------------------------------------------------------
[web]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 ansible_user=ubuntu

[db]
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.20 ansible_user=root
--------------------------------------------------------
âœ… Run an ad-hoc command to check connectivity:
---> ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini

2. Dynamic Inventory (For Cloud Environments: AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.):-
âœ… Automatically fetches hosts from cloud providers.
ðŸ”¹ Example (AWS EC2 dynamic inventory):
---> ansible-inventory -i aws_ec2.yml --list
âœ… Uses scripts or plugins to dynamically pull instance details.


### Difference Between Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands and Playbooks?
Ans.
1. Ad-Hoc Commands are One-time commands and used for simple tasks on managed nodes.
   They are primarily used for tasks like checking connectivity, managing services, and installing packages.
   Use Case: Restarting a service, checking uptime, or running a quick shell command.

2. Ansible Playbooks are YAML-based automation scripts that define a set of tasks to be executed on managed nodes.
   Playbooks are reusable, structured, and support advanced features like loops, conditions, and handlers
   Use Case: Automating infrastructure setup, application deployments, and configuration management.
