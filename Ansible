### What is Ansible ?
Ans.Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, infrastructure provisioning, 
    application deployment and orchestration by using YAML-based playbooks.
    It works by connecting to remote machines via SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows),
    executing tasks without requiring agents.

### What are the key features of Ansible?
Ans.
ðŸ“Œ Agentless â€“ No need to install agents on managed nodes.
ðŸ“Œ Simple YAML Syntax â€“ Uses human-readable YAML for playbooks.
ðŸ“Œ Idempotency â€“ Ensures changes apply only when needed.
ðŸ“Œ Scalability â€“ Manages thousands of servers efficiently.
ðŸ“Œ Pre-built Modules â€“ Extensive library for automation tasks.
ðŸ“Œ Orchestration â€“ Automates multi-tier app deployments.
ðŸ“Œ Secure & Reliable â€“ Uses SSH and Ansible Vault for security.
ðŸ“Œ Push Model Execution â€“ Executes tasks from the control node directly.

### Difference Between Ansible, Shell, and Python?
Ans.
ðŸ“Œ Shell (Bash/PowerShell):
âœ… Good for one-time execution for shell script but lacks of scalability for complex automation.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Shell is wont work with different OS.(linux,ubuntu,windows).

ðŸ“Œ Python:
âœ… More flexible than Shell, supports both Linux and Windows.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Writing a script to manage multiple services dynamically.

ðŸ“Œ Ansible:
âœ… Best for managing multiple VMs with different OS types.
âœ… Uses inventory files to define different hosts and apply the right module automatically.

ðŸ“Œ Final Recommendation:
âœ… If it's a one-time task, use Shell scripts.
âœ… If you want custom logic & flexibility, use Python.
âœ… If you need scalability, reusability, and automation, Ansible is the best choice.
